"The significant decline in EPS is primarily attributable to the share split implemented during the year. Following the split, the number of outstanding shares increased substantially, resulting in a lower EPS. Prior period EPS figures have also been restated in accordance with accounting standards, hence the apparent discrepancy between annual reports.",,,,,,,,,,
